GTK+ OS X SDK
=============

Copyright (C) 2007, 2008 Imendio AB

The files that are found in this repository can be used to create a
proper GTK+ SDK for Mac OS X, using the 10.4 (Tiger) SDK. This means
that the resulting frameworks will work on Tiger and later. The
frameworks are built after common Mac standards and integrates with
the system and the Xcode IDE (2.5 or newer) as well as possible, while
still making it possible to build against them using autotools.

Building and installing your own SDK using these files is not
recommended for end-users, instead its recommended to download a
prebuilt installer.


Steps to create a working SDK
-----------------------------

1. Bootstrap and build the dependencies. You need a recent version of
   jhbuild and latest jhbuild setup from:

   http://live.gnome.org/GTK%2B/OSX

   You also need the file:

   http://github.com/rhult/gtk-osx-build/raw/master/jhbuildrc-gtk-osx-cfw-10.4

   Symlink or copy it into:

   ~/.jhbuildrc-cfw-10.4

2. Build jhbuild with the cfw-10.4 setup:

   JHB=cfw-10.4 jhbuild bootstrap
   JHB=cfw-10.4 jhbuild build

   It is important that you only use this jhbuild setup for the
   framework creation. Do not attempt to use it to build anything else
   or do any manual building. Use a different setup for that.

3. The next step is to build the frameworks:

   cd framework
   ./create-frameworks.sh

   Once this is completed, a number of frameworks will be found in the
   framework directory.

4. At this point, you can either install the frameworks on your system
   (for example to test them), or create package installers for
   distribution.

   4a. Installing them into /Library/Frameworks:

       ./install-frameworks.sh

   4b. Creating installers:

       ./create-installers.sh

       This will create mpkg files in the framework directory.

If the installer is installed, there will also be an Xcode template
installed, that will turn up in the User Templates of Xcode, when you
create a new project.


Creating stand-alone applications
---------------------------------

NOTE: This section needs a bit of updating, and doesn't work.

Applications that have been built using the "Release" build
configuration in Xcode can be converted to be stand-alone as follows:

1. Copy the application bundle from the "build/Release" directory in
   your project directory.

2. Run make-standalone.sh with your application bundle as argument.
   The script will copy the Gtk.framework into your application bundle
   and make the necessary modifications.

3. Ship it!


Known issues
------------

* This is all still in the beta stage.

* The binaries are not universal, but Intel only. Universal builds is
  not a high priority currently, so don't except it soon.

* Translations are not yet included.

* The binaries do still contain debugging information. This debugging
  information is only of use to get proper stack traces at this
  moment. At some point stripped binaries will be created (run-time
  frameworks).

* A script/application to transform the application created with Xcode
  to a stand-alone binary (with the framework included inside) has not
  yet been included. We are still investigating what the best way is
  to include this. At some later point this will appear as a small
  application or as a separate target in Xcode.
